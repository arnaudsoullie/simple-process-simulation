# Simple Process Simulation
HTML/JS process simulation interacting with a modbus device

This project was created for our workshop on PLC code security at DEFCON 30.
The idea is to be able to "see" a physical process when developping PLC code.

To do so, a HTML/JS webpage simulates and displays the state of the process based on values gathered from a Modbus PLC. This can a real PLC or of software PLC, or even a PLC simulator.
